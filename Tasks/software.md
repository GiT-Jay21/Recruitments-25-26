# Software Recruitment Task 2025-26

Welcome to the recruitment process for the Software team! In this round, you'll tackle tasks that evaluate not just your coding ability but also your methodology in model training and dataset creation. We encourage you to leverage available free resources like Kaggle, Google Colab, and Roboflow—but remember, the core focus is on your understanding of the tools and techniques.

## Task 1: Ball Detection Dataset & Model Training

### Overview

In this task, you will:

- **Create a Ball Detection Dataset:**

  - Use [Roboflow](https://app.roboflow.com/) to build your own dataset for ball detection.
  - You may use no more than 20 images. This exercise is designed to introduce you to the basics of dataset creation on Roboflow.

- **Train a Model:**
  - Train your model on a free GPU using either [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
  - Optionally, you can incorporate any open source dataset you find online. The dataset need not be specific to RoboCup Robosoccer, but extra points will be awarded for a well-curated dataset.

### Deliverables

Please include the following in your submission:

- **Trained Model File:**  
  Your model should be saved in one of these standard formats: `.pt`, `.pth`, `.bin`, `.onnx`, `.t5`, or any other common type.

- **Roboflow Dataset Image:**  
  Attach an image from the dataset you created in Roboflow within your Markdown submission.

- **Link to Open Source Dataset (if used):**  
  Provide the URL or reference to the open source dataset you used, if applicable.

> **Note:** We are more interested in your methodology—the thought process, data curation, and implementation steps—rather than the sheer scale of your models or datasets. Using small models and datasets is encouraged.
