- Highlight task dependencies and milestones.
- Create a comprehensive Gantt chart outlining the project schedule.

### Instructions

   - Identify dependencies, priorities, and logical sequences.

2. **Choose Your Tool:**  
   You may use any of the following tools to create your Gantt chart:

   - **GanttProject:** An open-source tool, easy to download.
   - **EdrawMax Online:** A flexible online diagramming tool.
   - **Excel:** Use built-in templates or design your custom chart.

3. **Gantt Chart Requirements:**

   - Clearly list all tasks with their start and end dates.
   - Indicate task dependencies and key milestones.
   - Ensure the chart reflects a well-organized, realistic project timeline.

4. **Submission Format:**
   - Export your Gantt chart as an **.xlsx** file.
   - Include brief documentation (within the Excel file or as a separate Markdown document) that outlines your methodology and reasoning.

### Deliverables

For Task 1, please submit the following:

- **Gantt Chart File:**  
  Submit a completed **.xlsx** file containing the Gantt chart you created based on the scenario.
- **Supporting Documentation (Optional):**  
  Attach any notes or brief explanations that detail your thought process and planning strategy.
